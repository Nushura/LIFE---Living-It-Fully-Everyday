                <p class="aboutpara"><br>LIFE was started in 2021 with the main purpose of mental wellness in mind. 
                    One in four young people goes through depression and sadness, and we believe technology can 
                    bring services right to the comfort of your home. One of the most vital reasons why LIFE was 
                    created was because of COVID-19. It can potentially cause prolonged mental challenges. The 
                    lockdowns had and are still having effects on people around the world. Anxiety, uncertainty 
                    and rage are common as a result of the virus as per a report published by the Australian 
                    Institute of Health and Welfare (Australian Government).  
                    <br><br>
                      LIFE is not working to gain any profit out of this website but has a purpose to help as many 
                    people as possible in terms of usersâ€™ wellness journey. It is based in Melbourne, Australia 
                    but our services can be accessed from all over the world.
